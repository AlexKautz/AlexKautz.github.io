    description: During this ten-week internship, I developed a role-based access control system for one of 1010Data’s internal tools. This was written in Python using libraries such as Flask and SQLAlchemy. I also learned enterprise skills including agile development, unit testing, and test-driven development. I worked as a part of a five-person team and worked in a large, pre-existing codebase.

    description: Implemented an interactive graphical user interface for IBRelight, an image-based rendering and relighting tool for cultural heritage applications.

The interface allows the user to view the object under different lighting conditions and from any position in space. <br> <br> Paper “<a href="https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/ibrelight-an-image-based-3d-renderer-for-cultural-heritage">IBRelight An Image-Based 3D Renderer for Cultural Heritage</a>”, by Michael Tetzlaff, Gary Meyer, and Alex Kautz.
